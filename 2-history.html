    <p>
      Persona is a popular role-playing game series developed by Atlus, a Japanese video game company. The series is a spin-off of the larger Shin Megami Tensei franchise and has gained a dedicated fanbase for its unique blend of traditional RPG mechanics, social simulation elements, and deep storytelling.

      The game itself however has many different entries in the series, each with its own unique take on the core mechanics and themes. The first game in the series, Revelations: Persona, was released in 1996 for the PlayStation. It introduced players to the concept of Personas, which are manifestations of a character's inner self that can be summoned in battle.

The game follows a group of high school students who awaken to their Persona abilities and form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, aiming to change the corrupt hearts of adults in society.
